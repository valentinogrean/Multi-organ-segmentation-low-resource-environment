# Multi-organ-segmentation-low-resource-environment
This is the implementation for the article Multi-organ segmentation in a low resource architecture by Valentin Ogrean and Remus Brad. 

The implementation uses the miscnn framework - https://github.com/frankkramer-lab/MIScnn

- segthor-***.py -> training DL networks using different strategies (single, multi-organ)
- segthor-evaluation-***.py -> automatic segmentation generation based on trained networks
- utils/utils.py -> different methods used in fusion of results, preprocessing, supporting calculations
